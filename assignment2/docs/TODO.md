# TODO — Layered Implementation Plan

> Each layer corresponds to one or more commits. **Definition of Done (DoD)** is explicit per layer: code + tests + docs updated. Status uses `[ ]` pending, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done.

Reference: [`PRD.md`](PRD.md), [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md).

## Layer 1 — Data layer ✅

Commit: `Layer 1: data pipeline (yfinance, features, splits, windows) + tests`

- [x] `shared/config.py` — JSON loader, dotted access, version check
- [x] `shared/logger.py` — stdlib logger factory
- [x] `shared/seed.py` — `set_global_seed` (NumPy + Python + Torch)
- [x] `shared/gatekeeper.py` — token-bucket rate-limiter + retry/backoff
- [x] `shared/types.py` — `Action`, `Transition`, `StepInfo`, `SliceData`
- [x] `data/yfinance_client.py` — fetch + parquet cache + CSV fallback + MultiIndex collapse
- [x] `data/feature_engineer.py` — the 8 market channels (log_return, RSI, MACD×3, BB%, VWAP-dist, volume-z)
- [x] `data/splitter.py` — chronological 70/15/15
- [x] `data/scaler.py` — fit-once contract + save/load
- [x] `data/window_builder.py` — `(N, 30, 8)` stride-1 windows
- [x] `services/data_service.py` — features-first-then-split pipeline (causal indicators ⇒ no leakage)
- [x] Unit tests for every module (32 unit tests, 2 integration tests)
- [x] **39/39 tests pass**, **94% statement+branch coverage**, **ruff clean**, **largest file 80 LOC**

**Note** — pipeline ordering corrected during integration testing: features are computed on the full raw series first (all indicators are causal, so no leakage) *then* split, scaled on train only, and windowed. Documented as ADR-007 in PLAN.md.

**DoD met:** `uv run pytest tests/ -q` → 39 passed. Coverage of `data/` ≥ 90% (all modules ≥ 90%, three at 100%). Pipeline runs end-to-end on a synthetic 400-day OHLCV through `DataService.run()`.

---

## Layer 2 — Environment ✅

Commit: `Layer 2: TradingEnv + RewardFunction + Portfolio + tests`

- [x] `environment/portfolio.py` — cash, shares, MTM, all-in/all-out trade execution with symmetric friction (`α + β` per leg, applied multiplicatively to cash)
- [x] `environment/reward.py` — `BaselineReward`, `RiskAdjustedReward` (rolling annualised Sharpe), `build_reward` factory, abstract `RewardFunction` base
- [x] `environment/trading_env.py` — `reset`, `step`, observation assembly (8 market + 2 portfolio channels broadcast over time), terminal logic, invalid-action no-ops with optional penalty
- [x] `shared/types.py` — already in place from Layer 1
- [x] `tests/unit/test_portfolio.py` — buy/sell/no-ops, round-trip cost, MTM, PnL, invalid construction (8 tests)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_reward.py` — baseline ΔV/V₀, first-step bonus disabled, zero-variance handling, positive-trend Sharpe bonus, factory (8 tests)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_trading_env.py` — reset shape, step advance, position channel reflects holdings, termination, invalid action no-op, round-trip, post-termination raise, channel-count guard (9 tests)
- [x] **64/64 tests pass**, **95% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file 99 LOC

**ADR-008 added (PLAN.md)** — friction is folded into cash on each trade (`Portfolio.buy/sell`), not applied as a separate term in the reward. This eliminates double-counting between the bookkeeping and the reward, and makes the reward formula `r = ΔV/V₀` exactly — the cost still appears in the round-trip test as the expected `−2·(α+β)·V₀` deficit, since it lives inside ΔV.

**DoD met:** environment tests green, coverage of `environment/` ≥ 96% on all modules (`portfolio.py` 100%, `reward.py` 98%, `trading_env.py` 96%). Manual flat → long → flat round-trip with no price change produces a small negative reward equal to the round-trip friction, as expected.

## Layer 3 — Model + memory ✅

Commit: `Layer 3: Dueling DQN + Uniform/Prioritized replay + target sync + tests`

- [x] `model/dueling_dqn.py` — Conv1D trunk (2 layers), shared dense, V/A heads, mean-centred aggregation. `dueling=False` collapses heads into a single Q head — the *vanilla DQN* baseline.
- [x] `model/dueling_dqn.py` includes `hard_update` and Polyak `soft_update(τ)` for target sync (target network is just another instance of the same nn.Module — no separate file needed).
- [x] `memory/uniform_replay.py` — circular `deque`-backed buffer; `Batch` namedtuple shared with PER for trainer-side interchangeability.
- [x] `memory/sum_tree.py` — array-backed sum-tree of length `2N − 1`; `add`/`update`/`get` all O(log N); `sample_indices` does stratified per-segment sampling.
- [x] `memory/prioritized_replay.py` — proportional PER backed by the sum tree; tracks max-priority for new-transition default; emits `IS_weights = (N·P)^(-β)` normalised to ≤ 1.
- [x] `tests/unit/test_dueling_dqn.py` — forward shapes, Dueling identity (`Q − Q.mean ≡ A − A.mean`), vanilla fallback, hard/soft sync, backward-pass convergence over 50 Adam steps (9 tests)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_uniform_replay.py` — empty/length/capacity wrap, sample shapes, IS-weights=1.0, no-op `update_priorities` (7 tests)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_sum_tree.py` — sum invariants, propagation, prefix-sum sampling, frequency proportionality, error paths (7 tests)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_prioritized_replay.py` — IS-weight normalisation, priority boost shifts sampling, invalid β/lengths (8 tests)
- [x] **95/95 tests pass**, **96% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file 99 LOC

**Note** — the `Batch` namedtuple is intentionally shared between `UniformReplay` and `PrioritizedReplay` so `TrainingService` is buffer-agnostic. Uniform replay returns `is_weights == 1.0` and is a no-op on `update_priorities`, by design.

**DoD met:** all model + memory modules ≥ 96% coverage (most at 100%). The Dueling identity is verified structurally (not just numerically). Backward-pass convergence test exercises the full forward + loss + backprop path.

---

## Layer 4 — Training service ✅

Commit: `Layer 4: TrainingService (Double DQN, ε-greedy, target sync, checkpointing) + tests`

- [x] `services/epsilon_schedule.py` — `LinearSchedule` used as both `EpsilonSchedule` (decreasing) and `BetaSchedule` (increasing); aliases keep call-sites self-documenting.
- [x] `services/run_directory.py` — per-run timestamped folder with `config_snapshot.json`, `git_hash.txt`, `checkpoints/`, `plots/`, `metrics.csv`.
- [x] `services/dqn_agent.py` — owns online + target Dueling nets, Adam, Huber loss, PER-aware loss-with-IS-weights. Double-DQN target: action selected by *online*, evaluated by *target*. Periodic hard target sync. `save/load` with `weights_only=True`.
- [x] `services/training_service.py` — orchestrates: builds env from `PipelineOutput`, picks replay buffer per config (PER or Uniform), runs N episodes, evaluates greedily on val slice, saves *best* (by `val_return`) and *last* checkpoints, writes `metrics.csv` per episode.
- [x] `tests/unit/test_epsilon_schedule.py` — clamping, interpolation, both directions (4 tests)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_dqn_agent.py` — action sampling, ε=1 uniformity, optimize returns None when empty, target sync at interval, Double-DQN path, save/load round-trip, dueling parameter count (9 tests)
- [x] `tests/integration/test_training_smoke.py` — full PER + Uniform smoke runs on synthetic OHLCV → checkpoints + metrics.csv present (2 tests)
- [x] **110/110 tests pass**, **97% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file 144 LOC.

**Implementation notes**
- `Batch` namedtuple is shared between Uniform and Prioritized replay so the agent is buffer-agnostic. `update_priorities` is a no-op for uniform — the agent calls it unconditionally.
- The val evaluation uses `epsilon=0.0` (greedy) and a fresh RNG to keep the metric deterministic.

**DoD met:** smoke runs complete in seconds. Both PER and Uniform paths exercised by tests. Checkpoints, metrics CSV, and config snapshot land in `results/run_<ts>/` as designed.

---

## Layer 5 — Backtest + inference ✅

Commit: `Layer 5: BacktestService + InferenceService + risk metrics + tests`

- [x] `services/risk_metrics.py` — `total_return`, `sharpe_ratio` (annualised), `max_drawdown` (negative fraction of peak), `win_rate` (closed-trade P&L); `BacktestMetrics` dataclass and `summarise()` helper.
- [x] `services/backtest_service.py` — runs greedy policy on a SliceData via the env. Returns `BacktestResult(metrics, equity, benchmark, actions, trade_pnls)`. Benchmark = Buy-and-Hold from day 0 of the evaluation window. `save_backtest` writes `<name>.npz` and `<name>.json`.
- [x] `services/inference_service.py` — single-decision API for the GUI/CLI. Takes a `(window, 8)` market window + position + scaled P&L, assembles the 10-channel observation, runs the online network in `torch.no_grad()`, returns `Decision(action, q_values, confidence)` (confidence is `softmax(Q)[a]`).
- [x] `tests/unit/test_risk_metrics.py` — 9 analytical tests: empty cases, known DD, zero-stdev Sharpe, alternating returns, win-rate, summarise schema.
- [x] `tests/unit/test_inference_service.py` — schema, argmax consistency, shape guards (3 tests).
- [x] `tests/integration/test_backtest_service.py` — full backtest on a synthetic env: full-horizon iteration, metric finiteness, save round-trip, benchmark initialisation (4 tests).
- [x] **126/126 tests pass**, **97% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file unchanged at 144 LOC.

**Notes**
- Plot helpers are deferred to Layer 7 (GUI) because matplotlib embedding belongs with the GUI rather than the headless services layer.
- The trade-PnL tracker treats each Buy/Sell pair as one closed trade and reports the difference of marked-to-market values — this is well-defined under all-in/all-out positioning.

**DoD met:** backtest on a freshly-initialised agent produces a finite metrics dataclass and persists both `.npz` (curves) and `.json` (metrics) artefacts. Inference returns a `Decision` whose `action` matches `argmax(Q)`.

---

## Layer 6 — SDK + CLI ✅

Commit: `Layer 6: TradingSDK facade + CLI (click) + tests`

- [x] `sdk/sdk.py` — `TradingSDK` with `prepare_data`, `train`, `backtest`, `predict`. Calls `set_global_seed` at construction. `TrainResult` dataclass bundles `metrics`, `run_dir`, `pipeline` so the consumer doesn't need to re-run data prep before backtesting.
- [x] `interface/cli/main.py` — Click-based CLI with subcommands `data`, `train`, `backtest`, `predict`. `--config` overrides the default config path. `dqn-trader --help` works as a console_script (registered in pyproject.toml).
- [x] `tests/integration/test_sdk.py` — end-to-end data→train→backtest→predict smoke (1 test).
- [x] `tests/integration/test_cli.py` — Click `CliRunner` exercising `--help`, `data`, and the full `train → backtest → predict` chain (3 tests).
- [x] **130/130 tests pass**, **97% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file unchanged at 144 LOC. `sdk.py` is 92 LOC.

**Notes**
- The CLI never imports services/environment/model directly — it always goes through the SDK, which is the architecture's load-bearing rule (PLAN.md §1).
- `run_experiment` is intentionally deferred to Layer 8 where it lives — keeping the SDK lean here.

**DoD met:** `uv run dqn-trader --help` prints the command tree; the CLI smoke test trains for 1 episode, runs a backtest, and emits a prediction in JSON.

---

## Layer 7 — GUI ✅

Commit: `Layer 7: PyQt6 GUI on top of SDK`

- [x] `interface/gui/plot_widget.py` — `PlotWidget` wraps a Qt-embedded `FigureCanvasQTAgg`; helpers `plot_equity(equity, benchmark)` and `plot_metric(values, title)`.
- [x] `interface/gui/workers.py` — `TrainWorker` and `BacktestWorker` (QThread) keep long-running SDK calls off the UI thread; they emit a `finished_with_result` signal carrying either the result object or the exception.
- [x] `interface/gui/_checkpoint_picker.py` — shared QLineEdit + Browse button row reused by the Backtest and Predict tabs.
- [x] `interface/gui/data_tab.py` — runs the data pipeline and displays the resulting `(N, 30, 8)` shapes.
- [x] `interface/gui/train_tab.py` — kicks off training off-thread, plots episode reward, shows the run directory on completion.
- [x] `interface/gui/backtest_tab.py` — picks a checkpoint, runs backtest off-thread, plots equity vs Buy-and-Hold, reports total return / Sharpe / Max DD / trades.
- [x] `interface/gui/predict_tab.py` — picks a checkpoint, runs `sdk.predict` on the last test-slice window, displays action + Q-values + confidence.
- [x] `interface/gui/main_window.py` — assembles the four tabs into a `QTabWidget`.
- [x] `interface/gui/__main__.py` — entry point: `python -m dqn_trader.interface.gui`.
- [x] `tests/unit/test_gui_smoke.py` — headless under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`; instantiates the main window (4 tabs) and exercises the synchronous Data tab (2 tests).
- [x] **132/132 tests pass**, **97% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file 144 LOC.

**Notes**
- GUI files live under `interface/gui/` and are deliberately excluded from the coverage gate (`omit` in `pyproject.toml`) — Qt event-driven code is hard to unit-test deterministically, so the smoke test is the contract.
- Screenshots are deferred to Layer 9 (final README) where they're captured alongside the experiments output.

**DoD met:** `python -m dqn_trader.interface.gui` launches the four-tab window; the smoke test verifies the structure without needing a display.

## Layer 8 — Experiments ✅

Commit: `Layer 8: comparative experiments + summary writer`

- [x] `services/experiment_service.py` — `ExperimentService` with four methods: `run_dqn_vs_dueling`, `run_uniform_vs_per`, `run_reward_variants`, `run_cross_ticker(secondary_ticker)`. Each method runs the same SDK train→backtest pipeline twice, only changing the dotted-config key documented as `overrides`.
- [x] Override mechanism — `_build_sdk(overrides)` deep-copies the base setup, merges the dotted overrides, writes a tmp config file under `results/`, and constructs a fresh `ConfigManager` + `TradingSDK`. This keeps ConfigManager's "load once, version-check once" semantics intact.
- [x] `_append_markdown` writes a row table to `results/experiments_summary.md` per experiment; `_<name>.json` captures the full structured payload (including run dirs for later inspection).
- [x] `tests/integration/test_experiment_service.py` — runs `run_dqn_vs_dueling`, `run_uniform_vs_per`, and `run_reward_variants` on synthetic OHLCV; asserts condition names, markdown/JSON artefacts, and field shapes (3 tests).
- [x] **135/135 tests pass**, **97% coverage**, **ruff clean**, largest file unchanged at 144 LOC. `experiment_service.py` is 106 LOC.

**Notes**
- The notebook is intentionally deferred to Layer 9 where it lives alongside the README — at that point we'll have real (not synthetic) experiment results to read in.
- `run_cross_ticker` accepts a `secondary_ticker` override so the same code drives the SPY and NVDA branches; cached parquet (or CSV fallback) makes this an offline-friendly call as soon as both tickers have been fetched once.

**DoD met:** every experiment produces a `ConditionResult` per variant and a row in `results/experiments_summary.md`. Smoke tests prove this end-to-end on synthetic data; running on real data is the Layer 9 task.

## Cross-cutting tasks (in parallel with all layers)

- [ ] `ruff check` returns 0 across the whole repo before each commit
- [ ] Each commit message follows: `Layer N: <short summary>` + bullet body
- [ ] No magic numbers introduced in code (everything in `configs/`)
- [ ] No file exceeds 150 LOC (excluding blanks/comments)
- [ ] `uv.lock` regenerated when deps change
- [ ] After each layer: update this `TODO.md` to mark items `[x]` and bump version where applicable

## Excellence extensions (only if base is fully green)

- [ ] Window-size sensitivity sweep (10, 20, 30, 50) and plot
- [ ] Reward-hacking sanity probe: log action distribution per episode, flag if Hold > 95%
- [ ] Add an attention-based explainability module that highlights which days in the 30-window mattered most for the chosen action
- [ ] Multi-asset portfolio extension (single-asset → 3-asset basket) — explicitly out of base scope
